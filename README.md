node-webkit-udp-test
====================

A simple interface to test UDP communications

To test this out:

1. Download the [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads) distribution for your platform
2. Follow the [rest of the instructions](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#quick-start) on that page to get you up and running

In a nutshell, you zip these two files, rename the zip to have an `.nw` file extension, and run it using the node-webkit executable.

Run two instances of this app, then just set the local and remote hosts and ports correctly.  
I've found, on Windows, it's best to stick to utf16le/ucs2 encoding.

If it stops working, close and restart.

Have fun :)
